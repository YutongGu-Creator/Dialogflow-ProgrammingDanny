**ProgrammingDanny is a chatbot I created with the goal of helping people learn Java.**

The core of the chatbot is to use a series of quizzes to dynamically profile a user.

The chatbot uses Facebook Messenger as its front-end tier, Dialogflow as its processing Tier for NLP and Firebase as its back-end fulfilment tier for storing functions and database.
